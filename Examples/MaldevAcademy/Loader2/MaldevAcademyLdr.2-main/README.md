> [!NOTE]
> Although this repo can be used to execute other binaries, the **whole focus** was on running the **mimikatz.exe** executable.
> This is for demonstration and testing purposes, as mimikatz.exe is a well-known post-exploitation tool.

## Most Notable Features

* **Stegnography:** Hiding PE payloads in *PNG/JPG/JPEG/BMP/GIF* files using [Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_wavelet_transform) with [Quantization Index Modulation (QIM)](https://sia.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2001-chen-wornell-it.pdf) and [Error-Correcting Codes (ECC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error-correcting_code). It is worth noting that the [Reed-Solomon Error Correction Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction) implemented by the PE loader is based on [SRI-CSL/jel](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/jel/tree/master/rscode).

* **Utilizing The GPU For Memory Scanners Evasion:** Using the [D3d11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/) library, the implementation moves the injected PE payload into the GPU memory when it's idle, hiding it from memory scanners.

* **Thread Stack Spoofing:** Based on [Cobalt-Strike/CallStackMasker](https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/CallStackMasker), the code searches for a suitable thread stack and masks the thread running the PE payload whenever the payload is in GPU memory.

* **Syscalls Tampering:** [Maldev-Academy/TrapFlagForSyscalling](https://github.com/Maldev-Academy/TrapFlagForSyscalling) is used to invoke tampered syscalls relying on the Trap Flag.

### Other Features/Tricks

* Handles API Set Dlls using [ajkhoury/ApiSet](https://github.com/ajkhoury/ApiSet).
* Loads the required payload DLLs in a random sequence to help against sequence-based image-load notifications (if any).
* Uses AES-NI from [Intel.AES-NI](https://github.com/NUL0x4C/Intel.AES-NI/blob/main/AES-NI/Aes.intrinsic.c) to encrypt the PE payload sections before affloading them to the GPU memory, and decrypt them after fetching them from there.
* Counts prime numbers for a specified duration as a method to delay execution. This technique is not executed by default.
* Unhooks loaded Dlls from the `\knownDlls\` directory without using `RWX` memory permissions. This technique is not executed by default, as some EDRs were able to detect the logic.
* If not using the aforementioned Syscalls Tampering technique, the implementation will use [HellsHall](https://maldevacademy.com/modules/89). Additionally, in the DLL unhooking routine, the implementation utilizes `win32u.dll` to execute the `syscall` instruction, as `ntdll.dll`'s text section will be `RW`, which blocks us from jumping to a `syscall` instruction there.
* Overwrite **EDR C**'s VEH that is used to handle `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION` exceptions, as this vendor was found to be using `PAGE_GUARD` permissions to trigger exceptions when accessing fake DLLs:

  The code is refactored from [mannyfreddy](https://github.com/mannyfred) in the [Introduction to Vectored Handler Manipulation](https://maldevacademy.com/new/modules/69) module.
* Manually fetching resource section payloads, avoiding APIs like `FindResourceW` and `LoadResource`.

<br>
<br>

## Usage - RunPeFile

[RunPeFile](https://github.com/Maldev-Academy/MaldevAcademyLdr.2/tree/main/RunPeFile) is the main binary file that will execute the provided EXE from the stored PNG file(s) in its resource section. Some notes when compiling `RunPeFile`:

* Using the [Configuration.h](https://github.com/Maldev-Academy/MaldevAcademyLdr.2/blob/main/RunPeFile/Configuration.h) header file, one can add and remove features.
* Define the [ _DEBUG](https://github.com/Maldev-Academy/MaldevAcademyLdr.2/blob/main/RunPeFile/DebugMacros.h#L11) macro to enable the debug mode. Or compile in Debug mode.
* In the repository, the current `RunPeFile` implementation will run `mimikatz.exe`.
* One should utilize the `FileConstructor.py` script to update the payload delivered by `RunPeFile`.

<br>

## Usage - FileConstructor.py

The `FileConstructor.py` script is the main script used to generate PNG files containing the DWT-encoded EXE payload. These PNGs are placed in the `EncodedPngs` directory, from which the updated `RunPeFile` project embeds them into the resource section of the compiled binary. Each EXE is split into multiple chunks, with every chunk embedded into its own PNG image. As a result, you'll see several PNG files that all display the same picture. This chunking is necessary because the steganography method (based on DWT combined with Reedâ€“Solomon error correction) typically cannot fit an entire EXE payload into a single image (depending on the size/pixels in the PNG, as well as the size of the payload). This script relies on the [NUM_SPLIT_PARTS ](https://github.com/Maldev-Academy/MaldevAcademyLdr.2/blob/main/FileConstructor.py#L15) constant to determine how many chunks the input EXE will be split into.

`FileConstructor.py` handles the Visual Studio Project files of `RunPeFile`, as well as the chunking logic. It calls the `DwtStegPeFileToPng.py` script to do the actual payload embedding. 

Examples of calling `FileConstructor.py` are:

```
# Adds the embedded PNG(s) to the 'RunPeFile\RunPeFile.vcxproj' project by dafault:
python.exe .\FileConstructor.py --pe mimikatz.exe --png memes\cat.png                              

# Adds the embedded PNG(s) to the 'XYZ\XYZ.vcxproj' project:
python.exe .\FileConstructor.py --pe mimikatz.exe --png memes\cat.png --project XYZ\XYZ.vcxproj   
```


<br>

### Usage - DwtStegPeFileToPng.py

The `DwtStegPeFileToPng.py` script is the main script that handles implementing the DWT algorithm to encode a given file into a specified PNG one. It is a stand-alone script and can be used in other scenarios, but in this repository, it's called through the `FileConstructor.py` script only. Below is how `DwtStegPeFileToPng.py` can be called:

```
usage: DwtStegPeFileToPng.py [-h] (--encode | --decode) --png PNG --output OUTPUT [--file FILE] [-v]

DWT-based steganography tool for hiding files in PNG images

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --encode         Encode/embed a file
  --decode         Decode/extract a file
  --png PNG        PNG image file
  --output OUTPUT  Output file path
  --file FILE      File to embed (required for --encode)
  -v, --verbose    Verbose output
```


<br>

### Usage - ExtractPePayloadFromPng

The `ExtractPePayloadFromPng` project is a standalone tool for pulling payloads out of PNG files. It can handle single images, or, when given the PNG containing the first chunk of a split PE file, it will reconstruct the full payload across all related PNGs. For example, calling `ExtractPePayloadFromPng.exe` like this:

```
.\ExtractPePayloadFromPng.exe --i ..\..\EncodedPngs\mimikatz_part01.png --o mimikatz.exe
```

Will pull the full mimikatz.exe binary from the PNG files located under the `EncodedPngs` directory.


<br>

## Limitations

* The Stack spoofing technique implemented was tested on Windows 11 only. 
* To move the PE payload sections back and forth from and to the GPU memory, one should have a Direct3D-11 capable GPU (discrete or integrated), a WDDM 1.1+ driver, and have the DirectX 11 runtime installed. 
* Only x64 PE payloads are supported.

## Demo

> [!NOTE]
> Some EDRs required further tweaks to the code for a successful bypass. Some features were enabled or disabled depending on the security vendor encountered.
